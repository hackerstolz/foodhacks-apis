#HelloFresh Challenge - Data

##General Dataset Description
- HelloFresh will provide you with a list of ingredient names and the language they're written in.

##Challenge Description
- The goal for this challenge is to extract more information regarding it's ingredients.
- For instance, we have thousands of ingredients that could be categorized into probably under 100 groups. For example, "sirloin steak" should become "beef". "Pork cutlet" should become "pork". The 394857439 different spellings and types of tomatoes should just be "Tomatoes". "Russet potatoes", "golden potatoes" should become "potatoes".
- Another approach could be to categorize each ingredient by cuisine or cuisines where they can traditionally be found.
- You might want to integrate wikipedia or (introduce other source of info here) to be able to match the HelloFresh ingredient names to a particular category.
