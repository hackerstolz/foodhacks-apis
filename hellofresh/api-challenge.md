#HelloFresh Challenge - API

##General API Description
- The HelloFresh API endpoing can be found in (api url tbd).
- It's documentation can be found in (api-docs url tbd).
- The HelloFresh API is currently powering most of our customer facing applications, both iOS and Android apps as well as website.
- Using the `/recipes` endpoints you are able to search for recipes, and get detailed information of each recipe, including nutritional information, ingredients used and quantities, customer rating, and much more.
- Available clients (link to js, php, angular and python clients)

##Challenge Description
- The goal of the challenge is to allow customers to find an HelloFresh recipe with ingredients that they might have at home.
- Built some sort of app (mobile, web app, console, whatever) that will allow the user to input random ingredients he might have at home and will return some recipes that can be cooked with those ingredients.
- You can add extra features like, returning recipes that would contain half of the ingredients and encourage the user to quickly go to the nearest sp√§ti to buy what's missing.
- Any other features that would enrich the application will be considered.
