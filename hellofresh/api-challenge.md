# HelloFresh Challenge - API

## General API Description
- The HelloFresh API is currently powering most of our customer facing applications: both our iOS and Android apps as well as website.
- All the documentation you will need to interact with the HelloFresh API you can get:
  - On this documentation page: http://hellofresh.github.io/slate/.
  - Plus by attending the API workshop that our Head of Platform Engineering (@pgscandeias) will give at the event.
- To be able to interact with our API, you will need an access token. The URL to retrieve a token for will be communicated at the event.

## Challenge Description
- The goal of the challenge is to allow customers to find a HelloFresh recipe they can cook with ingredients that they would have at home.
- Any type of application can be delivered for this challenge (mobile, web app, or even a console app) although a mobile app that can run natively on either iOS or Android is preferred.
- UX and UI will also be under apreciation, and they should be consistent with the look & feel you can find on the HelloFresh websites and apps.
- Failure resilience is also an important characteristic of your codebase. The app should fail gracefully if it's not connected to the internet, if the API endpoints are not accessible, or if the API responses are not exactly as expected.

Have fun!
